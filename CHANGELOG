Culvert changelog.

2009/08/10:
  - Started adding support for collecting NetFlow packets sent from
    network equipment.

2009/08/06:
  - Fixed up some threadding issues including an accidental deadlock.

2009/08/05:
  - Removed set_state() method from Flow.Flow(), just use the setter
    instead.

2009/08/04:
  - Name changed to Culvert because I like it more.
    Stability fixes and threading improvements.
    Bits per second and packets per second calculated better.

2009/07/30:
  - Updating flow engine and corresponding modules to use Pike 7.8's
    getters and setters, and hopefully giving finer-grained threadsafety.

2009/07/29:
  - Added IP.prefix() helper function which tries to intuit whether to
    clone an IP.v4.Prefix or IP.v6.Prefix.

2009/07/28:
  - Added reverse() method to IP.v[4,6].Prefix which returns an array of
    reverse zones needed to delegate this prefix.

2009/07/09:
  - Added reverse() method to IP.v[4,6].Address which returns a string
    giving the full reverse zone name for this address.
